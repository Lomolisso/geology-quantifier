# Geology Cuantifier

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a basic geology quantifier that uses computer vision techniques for detecting minerals at a rock sample and calculating statistics of the rock.

## Project Notebook
Prior to developing any software, a research phase is needed for studying solutions. For the above, the project has a series of [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks that document this process.
